                    <p>
                        In the summer of 2021, Clubhouse had amassed a large user base, but didn't have a centralized 
                        place for all the app-usage information Clubhouse users might find helpful. Out of this came 
                        Clubhouse Commons, a website designed to serve as a hub to answer common questions about how 
                        to use the product.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="ui header">Problem</h2>
                    <p>
                        The main problem we faced in this project was the sheer quantity of information we wanted
                        to make accessible to users. From first tips for being on Clubhouse, to learning to monetize 
                        content, it was possible that users visiting the website would have very different goals. 
                        Despite this, the information needed to be well organized, engaging, and easily accessible 
                        for a wide range of target users.

                            To accommodate our wide target audience from brand new users to those looking to make the jump to monetizing
                            their content on Clubhouse, we knew that the Creator Commons would have to accommodate a wide range of goals. 
                            To facilitate easy navigation throughout the site, we made every topic available from the home page, while 
                            ordering them from basic to more complex topics. By using various header sizes, highlights, and nested bullet
                            point lists, we were able to make the content scannable, enabling users to easily access the subtopics they 
                            are interested in learning more about.

                            When we were initially drafting the content which would make up the Creator Commons, Anu and I realized
                            we had a doc with about thirty pages of plain text. In an effort to keep readers engaged across the whole 
                            article, we brainstormed different ways of presenting information, while highlighting the community of users
                            who helped shape much of the Clubhouse ecosystem at the time. We reached out to a list of thirty creators,
                            asking for audio clips responding to various prompts about their experience with a different aspect of 
                            Clubhouse. Not only did this provide an opportunity to have content be presented in a different format, 
                            it also highlighted trailblazers in the Clubhouse community and brought in the audio-based format through 
                            sound bites. 
                            <br><br>
                            Another key part of my responsibilities in this project was to create various infographics, quick start guides,
                            and labeled screenshots to accompany the text. Although there were previous guides from before the brand
                            redesign, I utilized the new typeface, logo, iconography, and color palette to update the feel of the imagery.
                            Additionally, bringing in the squircle helped unify the overall feeling of the Creator Commons.

                            Keeping in line with Clubhouse's virtual space-based concept, we settled on the name Creator Commons, 
                            and encouraged users to “explore the commons” as they might explore rooms on the app itself. Although 
                            the designs have since changed, the original cover art for the panels utilized Clubhouse's “squircle,”
                            along with several color palettes which were created in the rebrand. Additionally, to tie all the 
                            different types of content together—from the audio clips to quickstart pdfs—we continued to utilize 
                            the squircles in Clubhouse's signature eggshell color scheme.

                        Much of the design work happened in Figma, and then the website was built out in 
                        Notion to make the content easily manageable. Although Notion limited the layout and the 
                        way content could be displayed, it enabled Anu and I to quickly spin up the website.
