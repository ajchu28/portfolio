                        <p>In the winter of 2022, I applied to a research opportunity at the University of Chicago looking 
                            for a research assistant to help with a project titled “Gentrification and Social Mixing.” The 
                            data leveraged cell phone usage patterns in Chicago to give a more granular look at the effects 
                            of gentrification on the mixing of people of different races. In particular, the opportunity to 
                            visualize this dataset was interesting to me, so I sent away my application.

                        <h2 class="ui header">UX and Web Development Goals</h2>
                        <p>
                            Come January, I began working with my mentor to lay out a timeline for completing a website, 
                            as well as highlight the main goals of the project. From the initial ideation phase, we came 
                            to a conclusion: The design should contextualize the data you're seeing on the map and situate
                            it within a broader story of gentrification.
    
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="ui header">UX Solutions</h2>
                        <p>
                            To highlight the map content, I opted for the map to fill the entire screen, while leaving two 
                            panels which would contain the relevant information and controls to adjust the map view. This 
                            created two distinct areas, one for the story and one for controls, while obstructing the least 
                            amount of map view. 
                            <br><br>
                            To tackle our first goal, we created a storyline based way of moving through the map space. 
                            Different cards take you to different parts of the map and activate different layers, while 
                            providing context for the information you are seeing. In this way, the user can focus on analyzing 
                            the data presented without having to manipulate the map space themselves. However, for users who 
                            want more control over the view, the right side enables them to toggle all layers and borders, as 
                            well as provides a collapsible legend to fit within a readable area. 
                            <br><br>
                            A final feature to help contextualize the data was the use of the hover feature. By putting the 
                            data in a sentence, this enabled users to better understand what the data was showing them, and 
                            understand the differences between layers.
                            <br><br>
                            In the original design of the layout, the panels were semi-opaque and the background map was 
                            shades of grey, making contrast difficult and the text less readable. Later changes involved 
                            adjusting the base map to have higher contrast and increasing the opacity of the panels to 
                            create sufficient contrast to improve readability.  
    
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="ui header">Web Development</h2>
                        <p>
                            This project was built on Mapbox GL JS and Fomantic UI. At this point I was new to web design, 
                            having just taken broader computer science classes, and thus had a lot of learning to do to build 
                            anything at all. However, with some help from past professors and Wenfei, I was able to turn my 
                            wireframes into the website itself. 
                            <br><br>
                            Learnings from this website to take to the next project would be usability on mobile, currently 
                            the website is only usable on desktop, and adding a buffering page to create a better user experience 
                            when the website is first loading rather than waiting for all the layers to populate.
