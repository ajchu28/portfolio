                    <p>
                        While I was in college, the cost of lattes in Hyde Park doubled. The neighborhood UChicago calls 
                        home on the south side of Chicago went from having mom and pop sandwich shops selling $4 lattes 
                        to being replaced by Mint Mojitos from Philz, where a pretty penny lets you pick everything from 
                        the type of milk to type of sweetener.
                      
                    </p>
                    <img class="ui centered image" src="assets/philz.jpeg" style="padding-bottom: 20px;" alt="Philz Picture">
                    <p>
                        UChicago has a history of pushing for self-interested development goals in Hyde Park 
                        as it strives to create a college town to rival the Ivies in the East. The $8 lattes we sipped served 
                        as the inspiration for this research and design project. Wenfei Xu, a postdoctoral student at the 
                        Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation, and I embarked on a six month project to visualize spatial 
                        data on gentrification in Chicago. 
                        <br><br>
                        Historically, the story of gentrification is patched together using census data, telling a static 
                        story about the way it impacts the lives of people in gentrifying communities. Previous mapping 
                        projects showing gentrification in Chicago have looked at measures such as changing housing costs 
                        or changes in income at a tract level. However, in a city where gentrification and segregation go 
                        hand in hand, how might another view of the way people interact and live reveal more about 
                        segregation in gentrifying neighborhoods? How might that support or refute the claim that exposure 
                        to neighborhood diversity increases socioeconomic outcomes?

                    <h2 class="ui header">Breaking Down the Research Hypothesis</h2>
                    <p>
                        To really flex the skills higher academia taught us, Wenfei and I produced a 93 word, 
                        run-on sentence explaining the metrics we would be examining, weaving in big words like 
                        “spatiotemporal” and “epistemological.” This sentence revealed a key gap with the study, 
                        one that my work on this project would seek to bridge. How could an issue that is so 
                        fundamentally human, pervasive, and observable in our community become so inaccessible 
                        due to the language and culture of higher education? Thus, my primary role in this project 
                        became to make the findings of this study more widely accessible and engaging through building 
                        an interactive visualization. 
                      
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While school taught me to pinpoint meaning with precise word choice and complex sentences, I 
                        found myself drawn to the language of design as a universal language which fundamentally seeks 
                        to bring knowledge within reach. This served as the jumping off point for my background research 
                        for this project, where I looked for examples of great visual design breaking down a problem into 
                        something easier to digest. I found inspiration in the book Food and Drink Infographics: A Visual 
                        Guide to Culinary Pleasures and the map created to visualize Manhattan population density. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Food and Drink Infographics brings accessibility to the science, history, presentation, and creation 
                        of food by showcasing a multitude of ways in which complex terms can be broken down into simple 
                        visualizations (by julienne you mean cut into small sticks). On the other hand, Justin Fung made 
                        census data fun and showcased another way of looking at an experience we can all relate to. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From this inspiration, I started by sketching and then mocking up what I envisioned the website 
                        looking like. We would have a way for someone to click through and see a story of a neighborhood, 
                        a nice choropleth map, and maybe a way to select different cities once we had prepared the datasets 
                        for other places.

                    <p>
                       Now if I was at a company working on a team, I would probably hand off the beautiful mockups I 
                       made inspired by all the awesome designs I had seen to an engineer. They would tell me something like the great
                       example ChatGPT provided:

                    <p>
                        However, being the engineer on this project, that meant it was time for me to understand what was actually a 
                        technical constraint and what was something I could teach myself to do. In this process, I uncovered a few 
                        flaws in my design.

                        <h3>The Graph Problem</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Graph Problem What was originally a “nice to have” feature in my first mockup turned into a 
                            nightmare the more I looked into its implementation. To construct the histogram displaying the 
                            selected neighborhood’s exposure measure compared to the rest of the graph, I would need to add 
                            an entire engine (I was considering D3.js) to compute the statistics and construct the graph, 
                            just to show users how that neighborhood stacked up. Given the time constraints on this project 
                            and my coding ability at the time, I opted for a static key for showing ranges on the choropleth 
                            map. While I could’ve done a static histogram and mapped the interactivity over the image, the 
                            original intention was for this project to scale to multiple cities, so having a computed 
                            histogram for each city was a cleaner solution and opened the door to a potential future 
                            webpage on statistics for the cities.

                        <h3>The Layer Problem</h3>
                        <p>
                            Originally I served the exposure layers on a single tileset from Mapbox and loaded that layer every 
                            time the toggle changed. This led to immense lag in the first version of the map experience. To get 
                            around this, I changed the exposure layers to populate from multiple smaller tilesets, which could 
                            happen concurrently, and only loaded the tilesets once on startup, allowing for faster transitioning 
                            down the line.

                        Several weeks into the development of the map, Wenfei and I met and showed the map to some peers. With our 
                        embeddedness in the data, we had failed to sufficiently explain what the map was showing, and how this mapped 
                        back to gentrification. This led to the Exposure Data box and additional layers that a user could toggle on 
                        or off overlaying the exposure data. With the addition of these two features, it better helped contextualize 
                        the meaning of our metrics in more understandable terms as well as show how this relates to gentrification 
                        for someone who is less familiar with the segregation and gentrification within the city of Chicago. 

                        The final piece of the story was to comb through the visualized data and piece together stories. Wenfei 
                        put together a miniature case study on Beverly vs. Washington Heights and the stories that the three 
                        exposure metrics tell about the area. While there’s just one example, we envisioned this as a means by 
                        which someone could have their “hand held” through the data set. After learning how to look at the data 
                        set through a few examples, a user might be more able to peruse on their own and come to their own conclusions.
