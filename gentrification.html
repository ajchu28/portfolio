                    <p>
                      Anyone living in Hyde Park, the neighborhood surrounding University of Chicago’s campus, has a front 
                      row seat in witnessing gentrification in Chicago. However, gentrification is not just a phenomenon 
                      tied to UChicago’s seat in the South Side, and is experienced across large swathes of the city, 
                      according to the Urban Displacement Project. Historically, the story of gentrification is patched 
                      together using census data, giving a low granularity view on the impacts of individuals’ lives who 
                      are affected by gentrification. However, through the use of anonymized cell phone data, we were able 
                      to piece together a better understanding of the social dynamics influenced by gentrification in Chicago. 
                      <br><br>
                      The novelty of this data necessitated a novel way of viewing it. I was brought onto this project as 
                      the web designer and developer, tasked with creating a website which would help paint the story of 
                      gentrification through another lens. 
                      
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="case_study row">
                    <h2 class="ui header">Learning about the Problem</h2>
                    <p>
                      What does experienced exposure mean? How is that different from residential exposure? What do these 
                      mean in the context of gentrification? 
                      <br><br>
                      To gain a better understanding of gentrification and its impact, I conducted research by drawing 
                      upon my knowledge from various courses at the University of Chicago and immersing myself in relevant 
                      literature and geography-based readings. Although I was not directly involved in data collection or 
                      cleaning, this research served as a foundation for grasping the complexities of the issue and designing 
                      a better website.
                      <br><br>
                      Additionally, I looked through existing visualizations to gain inspiration and see what else is out there. 
                      When conducting this exploration, I imagined myself to be our target user: someone in academia, perhaps 
                      at a school like UChicago. They could be a student or professor looking to learn more about the impact of 
                      gentrification in Chicago and have seen this website presented at a symposium, since that’s what the 
                      postdoc I was working with had envisioned as the purpose of the website. However, we didn’t want to 
                      limit the audience just to people in the field of academia. With gentrification being a hot-button issue, 
                      we wanted to build a site that was approachable to the general public—a tool that they could use to explore 
                      the impacts of gentrification in their own city. Through these two lenses, I evaluated numerous other 
                      websites to gain a better understanding of how they conveyed their data set in a legible, engaging, and 
                      accessible way.

                        <p>
                          Wenfei, the primary researcher, and I sat down and brainstormed a myriad of possible features from interactive 
                          graph components to text based stories. Based on my technical knowledge and experience, I was able to do some 
                          research into each of these features and estimate a time cost—given our five month timeframe, we sought to 
                          design a site that satisfied our main problem while remaining possible to complete. 
                          <br><br>
                          Concurrently with the ideation process, each of us asked people in our circles to describe how they would 
                          want to interact with a data set such as the one we had. Both Wenfei and I had access to different audiences—
                          Wenfei worked with many other researchers at the Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation, while I talked to 
                          several students who had never thought critically about a map before. After modifying our ideas with some 
                          preliminary feedback from our target audience, I began the next phase of the design process.

                        <h2>Sketching and Wireframing</h2>
                        <p>
                          Based on the initial exploration, we opted for a simple sitemap—just the map page and an about page. 
                          From a style standpoint, we knew we were going to use the Fomantic UI development framework to style the 
                          website, so we decided to keep the presets. Most styling which would shape a user’s interaction happened 
                          in the map layer; keeping a simple, clean UI for the rest of the site would place emphasis on the visualization 
                          itself.
                          <br><br>
                          The majority of the wireframing centered around the way the map would display on a page and where the user’s 
                          controls would be. With this, we played with a few layouts but ultimately opted for a full-width, full-height 
                          map with semi-opaque control panels over-laying the top. Based on my research, this seems like a common layout 
                          to maximize the size of the map. It’s worth noting here that we designed the website exclusively for desktop use.

                        <p>
                          With our wireframe designed, I proceeded to prototyping the final layout. Because of the simplicity of the layout, 
                          the prototyping mostly served as a way to think through layer hierarchy (what layers appear first? How do you toggle 
                          through other layers?). We used these prototypes to collect another round of informal feedback from peers and friends, 
                          leading to a few conclusions moving forward: <br><br>
                          <b>1.</b> The response to our storytelling feature was very positive. People liked the guided interaction through the website 
                          because it made the data less daunting to digest. <br><br>
                          <b>2.</b> It’s not enough just to have the three types of exposures being toggled. How can we better contextualize this within
                          other data from the city?<br><br>
                          <b>3.</b> The initial base map color scheme (light grey and dark grey) is confusing because the water is darker than the land. 
                          People did like the simplicity because it wouldn’t detract from the information.

                  <p>As the designer and developer, I had the opportunity to execute our vision and bring the design to life. 
                    Over four months I built the website, which can be found <a style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #A52E2A !important" href="https://ajchu28.github.io/mapwebsite/index.html">here</a>, 
                    with Mapbox GL JS and Fomantic UI. The site 
                    is currently hosted on Github Pages. I had some basic HTML and CSS experience preceding this project, but 
                    hadn't worked extensively with Javascript, nor had I built a website from start to finish. Working on this 
                    project not only enabled me to refine my UX skills, but also further solidified my understanding of the interplay 
                    between design and implementation.</p>

                      I presented Visualizing Gentrification in Chicago: Uncovering Patterns of Social Mixing at the Spring 
                      Undergraduate Research Symposium at the University of Chicago. This event provided valuable opportunities 
                      to showcase the visualization, engage with the audience, and gather feedback. The insights gathered from 
                      these interactions were incorporated into my subsequent thesis project, <a style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #A52E2A !important" href="rideshare.html">Visualizing Chicago Rideshare Costs</a>.
