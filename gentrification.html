                    <p>
                        This research project led by Wenfei Xu, a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Chicago,
                        was titled “Gentrification and Social Mixing,” and looked at whether gentrification in 
                        areas across Chicago was followed by increased racial mixing. From three datasets titled 
                        Residential Exposure, Experienced Exposure, and Interaction Exposure, I worked with Wenfei
                        over the course of two quarters to build a website which would show the story behind 
                        these data sets.

                    <p>
                        With these data sets, the overarching goal was to breathe life into the data's story 
                        through the construction of the website. Thus, in my design, I needed to not only display
                        the layers of data, but also anything else pertinent to contextualizing the story behind
                        the data.

                            Using Figma, Wenfei and I went through several iterations of what the side control panels would look like.
                            We opted for the map to fill the entire screen, and decided to add two panels to each side third to help
                            focus the user's eye on the center of the map. <br> <br>
                            Early iterations had panels of various sizing and opacity, however in this process we determined that 
                            fully opaque panels helped the user read the small content better, and that panels which were too large 
                            detracted from the focal point, the map. <br> <br>
                            Additionally, we had several iterations of the way users would be able to toggle information, 
                            such as a drop down menu or various buttons. We settled on a combination of radio buttons and 
                            checkboxes because it suggests to the user which layers can have multiple selected concurrently, 
                            compared to which may only have one selected. Furthermore, collapsing the legends helped save space 
                            while still giving the user full control over which legends to have viewable.

                            The left portion of the webpage is composed of a guided walk through of the map space.
                            Although there is only one story at the moment, the component enables users to 
                            connect stories to places. It serves as an easy introduction to the data of the map, 
                            as it teaches users on how to navigate and read the map.

                        <p>
                            Finally, describing what the data sets represent was the last challenge we faced. 
                            To solve this, we added a hover component which would put the information for that
                            specific tract in a sentence about what the number means. For example, hovering over 
                            an area when the Experienced Exposure layer is on tells you that “there's a xx% chance
                            that two people who have visited this tract are different races.”

                        Over four months I built the website, which can be found 
                        <a href="https://ajchu28.github.io/mapwebsite/index.html">here</a>, with Mapbox GL JS and Fomantic UI. The site is currently
                        hosted on Github Pages. I had some basic HTML and CSS experience preceding this project, but hadn't worked extensively with Javascript, 
                        nor had I built a website from start to finish. Working on this project not only enabled me to refine my 
                        UX skills, but I also had the opportunity to implement the designs myself.
