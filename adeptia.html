                    <p>
                        When I joined the team responsible for creating Adeptia Labs, our goal was to streamline customer engagement 
                        with Adeptia's technology. Previously, the only way prospective customers could experience our flagship 
                        product was through a scheduled live demo. Adeptia Labs introduced a self-serve model, showcasing select 
                        features of Adeptia Connect to provide direct, easier access and reduce initial barriers for potential 
                        buyers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Adeptia Labs team was composed of several members of the product and marketing teams with myself 
                        positioned as the in-between for the two worlds. While Marketing was focused on conversions and 
                        Product on implementation, it was my job to construct the experience that 
                        would guide prospective customers one step closer to signing on the dotted line. I worked on
                        building the design system, creating the user journey, building mockups, and making graphics. 
                        This case study will focus specifically on creating the user journey.

                    <h2 class="ui header">The User Journey</h2>
                    <p>
                        When we started, the core functionality of the tech had already been built out, but the experience 
                        felt like a bunch of disjointed, shiny objects on the ground that a user might wander around to 
                        look at rather than a deliberate journey guiding a user through the experience.

                        </figure>

                    <p>
                        While sketching out the new user journey, there were a couple goals I had in mind centered around Gloria,
                        our prospective buyer's, experience:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Lower friction to Gloria’s first touch point with the product
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Capture Gloria’s contact information, ideally with permission to contact her later on about news relating to Adeptia
                            </li>
                        </ul> 
                        Gloria is part of a team at a big company who researches enterprise software that might 
                        be useful to her company—she’s one of the many people Adeptia’s sellers want to get in front of, and her 
                        interest in Adeptia’s product is the first step towards closing a deal. By showing her some proof of our 
                        product up front, the goal is to encourage her to continue to delve deeper into what Adeptia can offer and 
                        eventually schedule a call with a salesperson. In addition, capturing her email with consent to contact means 
                        we can continue to notify her of new feature releases to Adeptia Labs. 
                    </p>

                        <br>
                        This is the first draft of the user journey I came up with:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Gloria reaches the Adeptia Labs page on our website, perhaps via a paid ad</li>
                            <li>Gloria peruses the page, then enters her email address to gain access to Adeptia Labs</li>
                            <li>She is dropped into our Generative AI Knowledge Base feature. This feature is one of Adeptia’s latest in an effort to keep up with the GenAI craze.</li>
                            <li>There’s a CTA (call to action) prompting her to check out the rest of the features Adeptia Labs has to offer.</li>
                            <li>She clicks the CTA and is directed to make an account with Adeptia Labs, granting her access to the rest of the Adeptia Labs features and the ability to upload her own documents to test out with these features. </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <div style="width: 100%; padding: 10px;">
                        <figure style="width: 100%; padding-bottom: 20px; margin: 0px;">

                    <p>
                        After walking through this user journey with the rest of the Adeptia Labs team, I went on to create mockups 
                        and a design system for Adeptia Labs. Overall, we wanted Adeptia Labs to feel like the expensive cousin of 
                        our website. Definitely related, but conveying the premium experience a user gets with Adeptia Labs since 
                        the experience is gated by email entry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next step, get sign off from the CEO and CTO, two key stakeholders!

                    <h2 class="ui header">The Double Email Problem</h2>
                    <p>
                        In a meeting with the CEO and CTO of Adeptia Labs, we walked them through the user journey and mockups I had created.
                        However, in this meeting, we noticed a key problem with the user journey, which I'll call the Double Email Problem.
                    </p>
                    <div style="width: 100%; padding: 10px;">
                        <figure style="width: 100%; padding-bottom: 20px; margin: 0px;">
                            <img class="ui huge centered image" src="assets/userjourney2.png" alt="User Journey version 2">
                            <figcaption style="text-align: center; padding-top: 10px;"><i>The blue "@" indicates where Gloria 
                                has to enter her email. The yellow box is the core Adeptia Labs experience.</i>

                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        You might be wondering why we would want to capture Gloria’s email twice before she can even use most of the Adeptia Labs features. Each of the three groups 
                        involved in Adeptia Labs—Marketing, Product, and the CEO—wanted the emails for a different reason:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gloria entering her email on the webpage gives Marketing the ability to track where she came from (organic search, campaign, etc).</li>
                            <li>Product wanted the second email to set up Gloria’s Adeptia Labs account so they could persist documents she uploaded across sessions and limit her daily usage.</li>
                            <li>The CEO liked the idea of having two email captures because the second capture is a stronger signifier of interest in Adeptia’s product—
                               information that might be useful in the sales process.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even before presenting the first user journey to the CEO and CTO, I had a few reservations about the design. 
                        For starters, on the webpage where Gloria signs up for Adeptia Labs, we are messaging that she will be 
                        granted access to all of Adeptia Labs. However, when she enters her email, she is dropped into a seemingly 
                        random feature (GenAI Knowledge Base). Then, she has a very limited ability to interact with the knowledge 
                        base, consisting solely of querying a pre-loading document, before she has to create an Adeptia Labs account 
                        to gain access to the rest of the features. This disjunct between expectation and reality is especially penal 
                        when Adeptia Labs is designed to be one of Gloria’s first experiences with Adeptia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As it turns out, when everyone saw the mockups and was able to visualize what the user journey actually felt 
                        like, others had the same conclusion. We needed to fix the double email problem and better align Gloria’s 
                        expectations with the experience. While this realization didn’t end up costing that much time or resources, 
                        I did learn a valuable lesson as a UX designer. Based on the user journey mapping I had sent out, I assumed 
                        that other people could also conceptualize what that experience would look like, saw the issues I saw, but 
                        didn’t think they were a big deal. However, after walking people through the mockups in that meeting, I 
                        realized that the experience I saw in my head wasn’t crystallized for the rest of the team until I walked 
                        through the mockups. As such, other people didn’t realize this issue until they were actually walking 
                        through the experience for themselves. <b style="color: #A52E2A !important">With the ability to visualize this experience in my mind, I 
                        needed to take initiative in voicing my concerns earlier on and being a better advocate for the user.</b>

                    <p>
                        With a clearer understanding of my role as the protector of Gloria’s experience, 
                        I created v2 of the user journey.

                    <p>
                        To solve the double email problem, I made a few adjustments:
                        <ol>
                            <li>When Gloria enters her email on the web page, she will be dropped onto the home page of 
                                Adeptia Labs, giving her access to both features.</li>
                            <li>Rather than gating the rest of Adeptia Labs’ features behind an Adeptia Labs account, 
                                I proposed that we gate the ability to upload your own documents. Gloria would be able 
                                to see and interact with both features in Adeptia Labs using pre-uploaded sample documents, 
                                but if she wanted to try it out with her own documents, she would need to create an account.</li>
                        </ol>
                        The second adjustment had several benefits beyond creating a better user journey. By controlling what 
                        documents a first-time user could interact with, we were able to show them what the best use cases of 
                        our features were. Additionally, the processing times on these documents were much faster since there 
                        was no waiting time for uploading a document, giving Gloria a better experience. Finally, this reduced 
                        the number of documents uploaded overall, saving money on computing resources.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition to providing the user journey for this project, I also created the mockups, mini design system, 
                        web page, and promotional graphics for Adeptia Labs as well as running user testing and feedback 
                        collection for the project. The user testing was especially helpful to deduce ways in which it was 
                        unclear how to interact with the features, leading to the introduction of better sample documents, 
                        example questions, and overview information for each feature. Additionally, we uncovered some lag 
                        issues with uploading documents, for which we implemented better feedback about the status of uploads. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the first month after introducing Adeptia Labs, we saw website conversions increase by 20% as a 
                        result of Adeptia Labs. Adeptia Labs became our second highest performing conversion event. Although 
                        it is still early to see how Adeptia Labs impacts the buyer’s journey over the whole lifecycle, early 
                        signs indicate that the resource is being used as a data point in building prospective buyers' impressions of Adeptia.
