                    <p>
                        For Inventing, Engineering, and Understanding Interactive Devices, we were tasked with building
                        an interactive device for our final project. The requirements for this device were that it be
                        self contained, make use of several sensors, and be both elegant and neat in execution. My groupmate
                        and I settled on the idea of building an interactive fidget cube, which would have various functionality
                        depending on which side was active.

                        <h2>Designing</h2>
                        <p>
                            To make the fidget cube interactive, we used a variety of sensors which took different inputs and in turn 
                            triggered varying responses from the cube. For example, one side had a joystick controller which when moved, 
                            caused a piezo motor to vibrate. On another, we had an accelerometer that made LED lights flash when the cube 
                            was spun. However, with this multitude of sensors that we were trying to fit into a hand held cube came a 
                            huge design challenge of making everything fit. We iterated through several designs of the internal housing
                            mechanisms for the sensors, including 3D printing an internal casing or laser cutting acrylic to make the 
                            sensors fit snugly and thus support their weight. From this stage, we moved into prototyping our ideas.

                        <h2>Prototyping</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our fidget cube had several aspects that needed prototyping, from the circuitry to external casing to 
                            testing the functionality of our code. By testing the functionality of everything on the breadboard, 
                            we ensured that our Fritzing diagram was complete, that all of our hardware worked, and that our given 
                            battery was sufficient to power the fidget cube. Having everything mapped out on the breadboard also 
                            enabled us to test all our code beforehand while it was easy to make changes to the layout. Finally, 
                            it took several attempts to get the sizing right on our laser cut acrylic to fit the components which 
                            would stick out from the cube.

                        <h2>Engineering</h2>
                        <p>
                            What would engineering be without setbacks? We ended up creating two cubes, because the first Arduino 
                            we had controlling the fidget cube broke after most components had been soldered to the protoboard. 
                            This ended up causing trickle down impact because there was not another Arduino of the same size, 
                            requiring us to size up and change our Fritzing diagram on the fly, as well as reprint the acrylic 
                            casing. However, eventually we were able to get everything on pins and soldered to the board. Because 
                            we had been testing connections as we went to make sure each additional sensor was functional, by the 
                            time we finished everything, the fidget cube worked!
